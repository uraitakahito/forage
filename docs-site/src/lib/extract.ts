 * neither a glossary nor an interface worth tabulating, so this reads the file

// The meadow root. `docs-site` sits directly under it, and every script

// file and the URL becomes a path inside `dist`.

/**
 * The current text between `// #region <name>` and `// #endregion`.
 *
 * Throws when the region is gone — but whether that stops the build depends on
 * the page's extension, which is not obvious and was measured rather than
 * assumed (Starlight 0.41.4 / Astro 7.1.4):
 *
 *   .mdx — the throw surfaces through @astrojs/mdx's vite plugin and the
 *          build fails, exit 1.
 *   .md  — Starlight's docs loader catches it, logs
 *          `[ERROR] [starlight-docs-loader] Error rendering …`, and the build
 *          finishes with exit 0 and "Complete!".
 *
 * Every page in meadow is .md, so here the build is not a guard at all. The
 * one that holds the line is scripts/check-doc-refs.mjs, which exits non-zero
 * for both kinds. `pnpm run site:check` runs both; the workflows run
 * `site:check`, never `site:build` alone.
 *
 * The name must run to the end of its line. `\b` is not enough: a word
 * boundary sits between `s` and `-`, so a region named `scenarios` would also
 * match a marker reading `#region scenarios-v2` and quietly serve the wrong
 * snippet — the exact drift this mechanism exists to prevent.
